			<h2>Vibrational control of thermally activated reactions in <br/>the ground state by using time-resolved Raman spectroscopy</h2>
			<hr>
			<p>
				Observing the dynamics of proton transfer reactions in the ground state, 
				needs a technique with a time resolution higher than what can be achieved 
				by electronic means. A beneficial approach is pump-probe time-resolved 
				spectroscopy to monitor the path that the proton takes on a very short timescale. 
				It allows observing molecules during reactive processes, characterization of the 
				associated dynamics, and searching for transition states and transient species. 
				In these techniques, an ultrafast light pulse excites the sample and initiates 
				the process of interest. A second ultrashort laser pulse probes the properties 
				of the sample after a delay, which is the temporal separation between the two pulses. 
				The measurement is repeated with systematically varied delay times to sample the 
				complete evolution of an observable during the process under investigation.

			<h2>Flow liquid jet system</h2>
			<hr>
			<p>
				Most ultrafast spectroscopy setup requires a flow system to present a 
				new sample volume for each laser shot without windows in the optical path. 
				The current wire-guided flow jet system in the spectroscopy setup used in 
				our experiments consists of a nozzle, a wire guide loop, tubes, a liquid 
				chamber, and a low-pressure micro gear pump.

			<h2> Sub-ps Raman study of vibrational energy relaxation in solvents</h2>
			<hr>
			<p> 
				To characterize some solvents, fs-IR-SRS helps study ultrafast vibrational 
				dynamics in a group of alcohols. In this case, the vibrational energy 
				transfer within vibrations of liquid ethanol and methanol excited state 
				population distribution at all frequencies in the C-H and O-H stretching 
				region measured after excitation of the O-H band
